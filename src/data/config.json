The Ma'ayan Laboratory applies computational methods to study the inner workings of regulatory networks in mammalian cells. His research team applies machine learning and other statistical mining techniques to study how intracellular regulatory systems function as networks to control cellular processes such as differentiation, dedifferentiation, apoptosis and proliferation. The Ma'ayan Laboratory develops bioinformatics software applications to enable experimental biologists to form novel hypotheses from high-throughput omics datasets, while aiming to better understand the structure and function of regulatory networks in mammalian cellular and multi-cellular complex systems."
